# Section Description

Adequate and equitable school funding is paramount to ensure education equity goals are achieved in Washington state. However, the landscape of Washington state school finance and governance systems have dramatically changed in the past ten years. In 2012, the Washington State Supreme Court ruled that the public education funding system failed to meet the state’s constitutional duty to provide adequate education to Washington students. It was only in 2018 that the state legislature satisfied the court’s mandate, and the 2018-2019 school year was the first year of reform. However, COVID-19 significantly impacted the school finance picture starting in the 2020-2021 school year as schools, districts, and the state responded to the COVID-19 pandemic – addressing school shutdowns, technology needs, online learning, PPE costs, and more.
