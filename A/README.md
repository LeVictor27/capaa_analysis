# Section Description 

In this section, we will investigate student-level changes between the school years most impacted by COVID-19: 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. We use the 2018-2019 school year as pre-COVID year as a comparison. By using publicly available data from OSPI and the federal government, we provide a snapshot of student-level changes on enrollment, absences, course outcomes, discipline rates, and graduation pathways. Notably, we explore: what are student-level changes during COVID-19 compared to one year before?
